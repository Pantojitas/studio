# **App Name**: Topic Explorer

## Core Features:

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Purple (#800080) to reflect the original app's background. Choosing a deep, true purple emphasizes knowledge and exploration while diverging slightly for a modern feel.
- Background color: Very light purple (#F0E6F0). A desaturated, light tint of the primary hue ensures the background remains unobtrusive, letting the content shine without causing eye strain.
- Accent color: Lavender (#E6E6FA). Being close to purple, the accent color maintains harmony, but the brightness of Lavender provides clear visual contrast for interactive elements.
- Clean, readable font for topic names and descriptions.
- Simple, intuitive icons for community and favorite actions.
- Two-column layout for community cards to provide a structured and responsive design.
